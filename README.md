# Splitwise Plugin for Lunch Money

A plugin for [Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app/) to compare with transactions 
on [Splitwise](http://splitwise.com/)

Enter your API keys for both tools, then you can see the transactions from both 
side by side and split transactions in Lunch Money the same as they are in 
Splitwise.

For when you share costs with others on a trip or at dinner, etc, and your 
expenses in Lunch Money no longer reflect your actual budget.
